# Offloading Algorithm for Mobile Edge/Cloud Computing.

Deep Learning Neural Network that tries to decide the use of Cloud Computing power at the cost of network delay verus Edge Computing ease of access and affordabilty* at the cost not being able to handle large computational tasks versus local computation which is the most costly (power) but no delay.


Technologies Used: Python, Keras, Numpy, Pandas
